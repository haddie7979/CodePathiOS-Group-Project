## Overview
### Description
An app to alert and communicate with other teachers/administrators when there is an emergency instead of using the intercom for increased security and communication in school emergency situations.

### App Evaluation
- **Category:** Communication/safety
- **Mobile:** This app is being created for mobile use but would be useful as a website as well for access from any device for universal access to the alert system by teachers and administrators.
- **Story:** The stripped down version of this app may not be particularly interesting to peers or classmates, but they are not the intended audience. The value should be evident in the design and implementation of the app.
- **Market:** The market for this app is limited to school teachers and administrators to be used in the spirit of safety. Valuable to all grade schools, and potentially colleges and businesses if developed further.
- **Habit:** This app is not habit forming and the current stripped down version would only necessarily be used when there is an emergency that requires immediate campus-wide communication.
- **Scope:** This app is for teachers and administrators in emergency situations, but it has potential to be developed into a general communcation app for professional messaging and extend to all educational institutions and businesses.
